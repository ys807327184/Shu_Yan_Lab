Challenge: Merge Two Sorted Lists
	Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
	Example 1:
		Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
		Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
	Example 2:
		Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
		Output: []
	Example 3:
		Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
		Output: [0]
 	Constraints:
		The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
		-100 <= Node.val <= 100
		Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
